91,Here we go...
92,"Rockstar really knows how to craft atmosphere—this trailer doesn’t just show a game, it sells a whole chaotic, sun-soaked world. The characters feel alive, the pacing is sharp, and the details are unreal. If the final game captures even half this energy, it’s going to be unforgettable."

144,"Rockstar took so long I forgot what a video game is. I had kids, raised them, and they just watched the trailer too. It's a generational release now"
145,And I remember playing Grand Theft Auto - Vice City in 2002... It was a lot of fun back then.
